- **owner** (String): Owner of the track
- **published** (Boolean): Whether the track is published

### From `Challenge` (nested in track)

**Always Collected:**
- **id** (ID): Unique challenge identifier
- **slug** (String): URL-friendly challenge identifier  
- **title** (String): Challenge title
- **type** (String): Type of challenge

**Conditionally Collected** (when `include-challenge-assignments: 'true'`):

## üîß Customization

To add more fields, you would need to:

1. Update the GraphQL query in `get_team_tracks()` function
2. Update the data processing in the main loop
3. Update the file writing sections
4. Be aware of API performance implications for complex nested queries

## üìù Notes

- The `tracks` query accepts optional parameters: `teamSlug`, `teamID`, `organizationSlug`, `organizationID`
- The script queries tracks by team slug for team-specific track lists
- Tracks can have multiple challenges, each with their own properties
- The `published`, `private`, and `maintenance` flags control track visibility and status
- Tags are useful for categorizing and filtering tracks
- Challenge types may include various formats (specific types depend on Instruqt's implementation)
