## Actions GitHub Labels
##
## Note: When planning to migrate an old label to a new label,
##       you should first add the old label to the 'aliases'
##       section of the new label, then run label sync, and then
##       you can comment out the old label. Once the old label
##       has been migrated to the new label, across all repos,
##       it can then be deleted in this file.
