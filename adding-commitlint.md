# Adding commitlint to this repo


The new [`actions-ci` workflow](.github/workflows/actions-ci.yml), which is based off of [**commitlint**](https://commitlint.js.org/) ([commitlint GitHub](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)), has been added in an effort to enforce good **git hygiene**.

The workflow originated from [the _CI setup_ **GitHub Actions** section](https://commitlint.js.org/guides/ci-setup.html#github-actions) of the [commitlint guides](https://commitlint.js.org/guides/ci-setup.html).  The example workflow needed to be updated in order to run, but it should be working now.

The default commitlint configuration:
```js
module.exports = {
    extends: [
        "@commitlint/config-conventional"
    ],
}
```

#### Enforcing good git hygiene

Part of ensuring proper commit messages (and pull requests) will help with automating releases.  For example, the [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) tool can be used in a GitHub action, via [this semantic-release-action](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action).
