### About `actions/checkout`

The token you use when setting up the repo with this action will determine what token `get-next-semver` will use.  

### Working with PRs

By default, when you use `actions/checkout` on a PR, it will checkout the head commit in a detached head state.
If you want to make some changes, you have to checkout the branch the PR is coming from in the head repo.  
You can set it up like this:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
```

You can find the full docs for payloads of `pull_request` events [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#webhook-payload-example-32).
