        with:

          staleAfter: 60
          # do not set 'staleAfter' to anything less than 30 in production
          closeAfter: 180
          staleLabel: "STALE ðŸ“º"
          staleComment: "This issue is %DAYS_OLD% days old, marking as stale! cc: @%AUTHOR%"
          # you can remove or comment out 'staleComment' to use the default 'staleComment'
          closeComment: "Issue last updated %DAYS_OLD% days ago! Closing down!"
          # you can remove or comment out 'closeComment' to use the default 'closeComment'
          showLogs: true
```


### Template comment
 
 The comment is a template string with placeholders to use:

- `%AUTHOR%` - Issue creator
- `%DAYS_OLD%` - How long (in days) the issue was last updated

Example:

```yaml
with:
  closeComment: "This issue is %DAYS_OLD% old, closing down! Notifying author: @%AUTHOR%"
```
